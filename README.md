Yeast Consensus Metabolic Model
========================

This repository contains the current genome-scale model of _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ used in the @SysBioChalmers group. It's an improved version of the consensus metabolic model (version 7.6, downloaded from the developer's website https://sourceforge.net/projects/yeast/), FBCv2 compliant, with subSystem and EC number information connected to reactions, and with several issues corrected. The usage of this model is exactly the same as any other COBRA developed model.

This repository is administered by Benjamín J. Sánchez (@BenjaSanchez), Division of Systems and Synthetic Biology, Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology.
