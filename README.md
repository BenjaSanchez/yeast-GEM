Yeast Consensus Metabolic Model - AEROBIC BRANCH
========================

This repository contains the current genome-scale model of _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ used in the [@SysBioChalmers](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers) group. It's an improved version of [the consensus metabolic model, version 7.6](https://sourceforge.net/projects/yeast/), FBCv2 compliant, with subSystem and EC number information connected to reactions, and with several issues corrected. The usage of this model is exactly the same as any other COBRA developed model.

This repository is administered by Benjamín J. Sánchez ([@BenjaSanchez](https://github.com/benjasanchez)), Division of Systems and Synthetic Biology, Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology.
